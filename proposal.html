      What content do you plan to include in each page of your website? As you
      think through your website, please remember that the website must have at
      least 4 pages of content besides the homepage, sitemap, and
      contact/feedback pages.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am planning to put pictures and journals for countries I have travelled
      to lately. I would also include my travel plan as a page. Potentially, I
      could also include a currency convertor.
